                <h3 class="q">Q: How does the blind matching process work?</h3>
                <h3 class="a">A: The blind matching process uses a sophisticated algorithm to match two users based on shared interests, location, and other criteria. Each user receives only one match per session, and we take care to avoid repeatedly matching the same pair.</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="unit">
                <h3 class="q">Q: What safeguards are in place for women using the app?</h3>
                <h3 class="a">A: We take the safety of all users seriously, but we understand that women may face unique risks when it comes to online dating. That's why we offer profile verification and block/report options to give women greater control over their experience. We also encourage all users to report any inappropriate behavior or harassment.</h3>

                <h3 class="q">Q: How much time do users have to chat before deciding to meet in person?</h3>
                <h3 class="a">A: Users have a limited time period to chat and get to know each other before deciding whether to meet in person. We believe that this helps to create a sense of urgency and avoid the endless back-and-forth that can happen on other dating apps. However, we also encourage users to take their time and make sure they feel comfortable before agreeing to a meeting.</h3>

            <div class="unit">
                <h3 class="q">Q: What happens if I don't like my match?</h3>
                <h3 class="a">A: It's okay if you don't feel a spark with your match â€“ that's just the nature of dating! If you're not interested, you can simply let the chat expire and you won't be matched with that person again. However, we do encourage users to give each match a fair chance and see where things go.</h3>

            <div class="unit">

After your chat has ended, you'll have the opportunity to rate your experience and provide feedback on what worked well and what could be improved. We appreciate your input and take it seriously!</h3>
